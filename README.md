# Crunchyroll-Video-Tracker
This chrome extension continuously saves your progress in any crunchyroll video incase you lose your position. It can also be used to quickly navigate to the next episode in the series.
The extension will assume you are on the next episode if you reach past 80% of the current video. 
This is done so that you do not have to finish the outros of each video for the tracker to know that you are done.

Additional funcitonality: Intro skipping. 
A button will appear over the video if the current player position is less than the intro ending position.
The code for intro skipping is not mine and is credited in this extensions official chrome store page.

How to use:
1. Install the chrome extension from the chrome store or by cloning this repo and loading it as an unpacked extension.
2. Go to any crunchyroll video to start the tracking.
3. After the video starts playing, you should be able to see your progress get updated every time you click on the extensions popup icon.
4. The popup displays the title and next video image (or the current one if you did not reach past 80% of the last video).
5. Clicking the image will take you to the next video in the series.

There are a lot of other features that can be added to this such as fast forwarding, autoplaying next episode at the end of the video, and much more. 
I would like to have all of the many crunchyroll extension features that are on the chrome store to be put together into one extension. If anyone wants to collaborate on this, hit me up on discord.
